# ArbitaryCompression
"Compresses" Arbitrary files using MD5 cryptography. In theory, one can fully recover all the data, if they throw enough CPU power at it.

I do not recommend using this though, since it's entirely not suitable for anything. I mean it. Yes it will achieve 50% compression ratio, but so will most popular compression algorythms, and without requiring a super computer to "decompress" your data.

This program works on the principal of for ever X bytes of data, it will generate X/2 bytes in the form of MD5 Hashes. Functional, but actually garbage and should not be used.
